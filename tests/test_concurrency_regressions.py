"""Regression tests for high-impact concurrency defects found in v1.5.1.

These tests deliberately avoid importing the Windows-only modules
(``single_instance``, ``monitor_sleep_listener``) on Linux, and exercise the
*iteration pattern* rather than the full FlyoutWindow / App objects for the
dict-mutation tests — the pattern is what causes the bug, not the Tk setup.

Bug 1 — ``RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration``:
    ``App._on_model_resolved`` does ``lights[new] = lights.pop(old)`` while
    callers iterate ``self._lights.items()`` / ``.values()`` live views.
    Fix: every call site now uses ``list()`` snapshot iterators.

Bug 2 — double ``_on_monitor_sleep`` after listener restart:
    ``MonitorSleepListener.stop()`` posted ``WM_CLOSE`` but returned without
    joining the old window thread, so restarting the listener created two
    live subscriber windows for ~50ms → duplicate callbacks → pre-sleep
    state overwritten → lamp not restored on wake.
    Fix: ``stop()`` joins the old thread with a 3s timeout.
